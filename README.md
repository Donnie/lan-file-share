# Node.js-LAN-File-Sharing
A small Node.js app designed for sharing files while on the same network. Especially useful when you are trying to get a file from a friend and their device has a single broken USB port.

## Features
- Easy to use Drag and Drop file upload.
- Faster than uploading to a server then downloading since you are the server.
- Works with large files (tested with >2gb).
- Fast loading and opening due to light weight (no library) Javascript and customized bootstrap.
